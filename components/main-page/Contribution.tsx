          description="This paper describes a multi-user, mobile, cross-platform AR system that allows real-time remote collaboration utilizing the digital twinning concept. Thanks to cloud services, the users can collab-oratively manipulate and exchange information using digital twin realized as detailed multi-part 3D models. We also discuss design requirements and task analysis captured using engineering design methodology and the usability verification of our system using a heuristical approach."

          description="The object assembly process is frequently carried out throughout the lifespan of an asset. To prevent asset damage, it is necessary to perform adequate training to ensure process efficiency and appropriate asset handling. Thus, the industry constantly seeks better training solutions to reduce costs and maximize efficiency in the assembly task. Here, we present an augmented reality system to aid these efforts by using QR-tagging and 3D models. Moreover, we describe the system design using an engineering design methodology."
